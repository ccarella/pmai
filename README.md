# GitHub Issue Generator for Claude Code

## Foundation Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented the foundation for the GitHub Issue Generator following TDD principles:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Created feature branch**: `feature/github-issue-generator`
2. **Set up test infrastructure**: Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright configured
3. **Created core types**: Issue form data types and interfaces defined
4. **Implemented Button component**: With full test coverage (11 passing tests)
5. **Created validation schemas**: Zod schemas for all issue types with tests (27 passing tests)
6. **Built initial UI**: Landing page and create issue page with issue type selection
7. **All tests passing**: 38 tests passing with 100% success rate

### üöÄ What's Been Built

- **Test Infrastructure**: Complete Jest and Playwright setup for TDD
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for issue forms
- **Component Library**: Started with Button component following design system
- **Validation Layer**: Zod schemas for form validation
- **Initial Pages**: Landing page and issue creation flow starter
