# Pull-to-Refresh Implementation

## Overview
The Issues page now supports pull-to-refresh functionality, allowing users to refresh the issues list with a swipe-down gesture on touch-enabled devices.

## How it Works

### Components
1. **`usePullToRefresh` Hook** (`src/hooks/usePullToRefresh.ts`)
   - Handles touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
   - Calculates pull distance with resistance effect
   - Triggers refresh when threshold is exceeded
   - Manages refresh state and animations

2. **`PullToRefresh` Component** (`src/components/ui/PullToRefresh.tsx`)
   - Provides visual feedback during pull gesture
   - Shows rotating refresh icon that scales based on pull distance
   - Displays "Refreshing..." message during refresh
   - Animates content translation while pulling

3. **Issues Page Integration** (`src/app/issues/page.tsx`)
   - Implements the pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Uses separate `handleRefresh` function to avoid showing loading spinner
   - Maintains current filter state during refresh

### User Experience
1. User swipes down from the top of the issues list
2. A refresh icon appears and rotates as the user pulls
3. When pulled beyond 80px threshold, releasing triggers a refresh
4. "Refreshing..." message appears while data is being fetched
5. The list updates with fresh data
6. Smooth animations provide visual feedback throughout

### Technical Details
- **Touch Event Handling**: Uses passive: false to enable preventDefault on touchmove
- **Resistance Effect**: Pull distance is divided by 3 for natural feel
- **Scroll Position Check**: Only activates when scrollTop is 0
- **Refresh Timeout**: Minimum 1 second refresh time for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles refresh failures

### Browser Compatibility
- Works on all modern touch-enabled devices
- iOS Safari, Chrome for Android, and other mobile browsers
- Desktop browsers with touch support
- Gracefully degrades on non-touch devices

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for the `usePullToRefresh` hook
- Component tests for `PullToRefresh`
- Integration tests for the Issues page

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test -- src/hooks/__tests__/usePullToRefresh.test.ts
npm test -- src/components/ui/__tests__/PullToRefresh.test.tsx
npm test -- src/tests/integration/issues-page-pull-refresh.test.tsx
```
